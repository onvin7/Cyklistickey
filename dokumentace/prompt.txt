**Prompt for AI Development of a Comprehensive TODO List Application:** **Objective:** Develop an intuitive, fast, and advanced tool for managing daily tasks to maximize productivity, with seamless integration as a browser extension.1.**Basic Features (Web Application):** - Task Organization: - Allow users to create tasks with a title and description.- Implement deadline functionality with date and time.- Enable priority settings (low, medium, high).- Allow tagging of tasks (personal, work, school, shopping, etc.).- Facilitate assignment of tasks to various projects/categories.- Incorporate recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly, custom intervals).- Provide reminders and notifications (email/browser notifications).2.**Advanced Features:** - Drag and drop functionality for task arrangement.- Introduce subtasks with individual reminders and deadlines.- Allow marking tasks by priority using colors and labels.- Provide completion deadlines and alerts before due dates (e.g., one hour prior).- Create a completed tasks overview (history) with filtering options by date, category, or project.- Implement a timer (Pomodoro) to track time spent on tasks.3.**Integration Features:** - Calendar Integration (Google Calendar API): - Synchronize tasks with Google Calendar or other services (Outlook).- Display tasks directly in the calendar.- Tagging and Filtering of Tasks: - Advanced filtering by date, category, priority, labels.- Full-text search for tasks.- Dynamic tags with combinable filtering options.4.**Productivity and Analytics:** - Productivity Graphs: - Display graphs of completed tasks by day/week/month.- Show priority graphs of completed tasks.- Provide statistics on task completion times, delays, and common categories.- Analyze productive times throughout the day.- Productivity Dashboard: - Daily and weekly summaries.- Motivational messages ("Great job, you've completed 5 tasks today!").- Pomodoro timer for deep work sessions (25 min work + 5 min break).5.**Synchronization and Cloud Storage:** - Enable synchronization across devices (web, mobile, extension).- Allow user registration/login (optional).- Support data export/import (JSON, CSV).- Implement data backup to the cloud (e.g., via own API or Firebase).6.**Browser Extension Features:** - Provide rapid access to all TODO list functions without opening the main application: - Immediate display of today’s tasks and options to add new tasks directly from the browser tab.- Quick task addition with title, date, and time, plus tagging and priority settings.- Automatic date recognition from text input.- Integration with favorite websites: - Quick save webpage to TODO ("read later").- Option to highlight text on the page and save as a task ("read later").- Quick overview panel: - Provide a snapshot of today’s tasks with options to open task details in the web app.- Direct option to mark tasks as completed from the extension panel.- Customizable notifications: - Browser alerts before task deadlines.- Alert options for postponing or marking as completed.- Integrated Pomodoro timer directly in the extension.7.**User Interface (UX/UI):** - Design must be modern, clean, and minimalist.- Ensure intuitive drag-and-drop task organization.- Use color-coded priorities and tags.- Maintain a clear calendar view with task deadlines.8.**Technology Recommendations:** - Web Application: - Use PHP + MySQL/MariaDB for the backend.- Implement AJAX for seamless communication without page refresh.- Utilize JavaScript (with frameworks like React/Vue).- Apply Bootstrap or Tailwind for responsive design.- Include libraries for generating PDFs (e.g., TCPDF, MPDF).- Browser Extension: - Use JavaScript with local storage options (LocalStorage, IndexedDB).- Enable communication with the web application via REST API.9.**Security and Privacy:** - Ensure SSL/HTTPS for secure communication between the application and extension.- Provide optional user account creation (registration, authentication).- Implement password protection (hashing).- Ensure data isolation and security for users.10.**Bonus Features (for advanced level):** - Integrate with third-party applications (Google Drive, Trello, Notion).- Utilize AI for task priority recommendations based on completed task history.- Implement voice control for quick task addition.- Automatically summarize the workday (daily report via email).**Summary:** The ideal TODO list should combine simplicity and speed with advanced organization features (categories, projects, tags), strong browser integration (quick actions), productivity analytics, and a modern UI.If further development details or coding examples are desired, please specify.
